Vector operations,  and by extension matrix operations are mainly three kinds, (revisiting seriously after long time)

$+$ and $\cdot$ and $\times$ 
-  $A+B=$ take two vectors virtual, imprint? See where they would collide keeping symmetry, how they collide, that's a resultant vector,  that's answer
-  $A\cdot B=$ take 1 whole vector, 
- $A\times B=$ take two real vector
