Continuing from [portfolio - organizing projects](/note/20240730200309-portfolio---organizing-projects)

Other improvements that can be made overall, across docs-n-blogs and portfolio
1. [ ] add generated index for each tag recursive category, use mdx, docs-n-blog
2. [ ] add tags at projects page at https://arkaprav0.in/projects/ 
3. [ ] write some demo projects and then fix the docs-n-blog landing 3rd card
4. [ ] make the tags at portfolio site clickable and interactable (use react or solid**)
