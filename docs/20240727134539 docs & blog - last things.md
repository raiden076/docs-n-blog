Continued from [docs & blog - further improvements for later](/note/20240726154425-docs-&-blog---further-improvements-for-later)

So, blogs,
Things to remember:
1. Truncate
2. H3 for toc
3. Picture? 

These should be enough, to start and continue the blog.

- [x] Read more on the blogs: technicalities from docusaurus docs, [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) ✅ 2024-08-06
- [ ] Write the first blog from the topics already in notes, don't start a brand new topic
- [x] Change the landing page heading and subheading font color to match that of the portfolio, that's very sweet ✅ 2024-07-29
