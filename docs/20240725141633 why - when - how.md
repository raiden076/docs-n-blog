### Why

Because keeping track of what's going on in the head, and what needs to go on, according to what I am working on, at that moment and syncing them is important;

And and keeping notes public increases that observability, beyond anything ðŸ‘€


### When

These are short & sot so short notes taken while working on something;
so they can be disorganized and incoherent at best


### How

Usually notes, action plans, different analyses; categorized via tags
