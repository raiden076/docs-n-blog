Determinants, despite their apparently contrived definition, have a number of applications throughout mathematics; for example, 

 - They appear in the shoelace formula for calculating areas, which is doubly useful as a collinearity condition as three collinear points define a triangle with area 0.
 - More generally, the determinant can be used to detect linear independence of certain vectors (or lack thereof). 
 - The determinant is also useful in multivariable calculus (especially in the Jacobian), and
 - In calculating the cross product of vectors.
